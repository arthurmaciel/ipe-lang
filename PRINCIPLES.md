# PRINCIPLES.md

Every enforced rule of the Rust-backend project lives here, stated once. The
other governance docs — the root `AGENTS.md` (contributor onboarding),
`src/ipe-cli/templates/AGENTS.md.in` (Ipê language authoring reference), and
`docs/internals/dev-ops.md` (operational procedure) — reference this file rather
than restate it.

## The main values

Ipê is meant to be:

1. **Explicitly principled:** the values, principles, rules, and declarations in
   this document are entrenched eternity clauses. They and their priority order
   cannot be changed, even by a majority of the community. To change them (e.g.
   favor exclusivity over community-openness, or efficiency over security or
   correctness), fork the project and start a new one with different principles.

2. **Community-centered:** diversity is the foundation of the Ipê project.
   Respecting it in all its forms (age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity,
   race, culture, physical and cognitive ability, experience, socio-economic
   level, etc.) is MANDATORY. While respecting the values, principles, and rules,
   the community has full autonomy to modify and extend the language, always
   seeking consensus. If no consensus is reached after 3 rounds of discussion and
   votes, a fourth round elects the majority's decision.

   The core language and standard library stay deliberately small and principled.
   Breadth — new capabilities, platform and device integrations, domain libraries
   — grows as community packages built on these principles, so developers and
   users extend the language together rather than waiting on the core to cover
   every need.

## The six technical principles (strict order)

Ipê must embrace all the principles and rules below throughout development and
use.

1. **Security** — generated code and runtime give an attacker no foothold: no
   injection (SQL, shell, path, header, log), no secret leakage into logs or
   errors, no auth/CSRF bypass, no timing oracle on a secret comparison, no
   unbounded resource a remote party can exhaust. On untrusted input the safe
   outcome is the only reachable one — fail closed: absent proof the input is
   safe, take the conservative, secure branch, never the permissive one.
2. **Correctness** — the same well-typed Ipê program with the same input yields
   the same deterministic output, every run. Behaviour is defined by the
   language's own semantics, not any external oracle; a deliberate divergence is
   documented, never silent.
3. **Soundness** — a well-typed Ipê program can never trigger a runtime failure
   in the generated Rust: no panic, no `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` blowup, no
   out-of-bounds index, no integer-overflow abort, no unchecked downcast, no UB.
   Correctness is "the result is right"; soundness is the stronger structural
   guarantee that no input can make the program fall over. **Bounded by
   construction:** the compiler and the emitted runtime alike refuse work whose
   size an input dictates without a ceiling — every loop, recursion, and growable
   buffer has a declared limit. Source nested tens of thousands deep, or a decode
   of an absurd length, is turned back with a typed limit error before it can
   exhaust the stack or the heap; a process that instead dies on such input has
   broken soundness (and, when the input arrives over the network, principle 1's
   exhaustion clause too).
4. **Efficiency** — within the bounds of 1–3: no needless allocation or cloning,
   no hot-path recomputation, no O(n²) where O(n) is trivial, small binary and
   memory footprint. Never bought by trading a higher principle.
5. **Ease of use** — the language stays out of the developer's way: a small,
   predictable surface, sensible defaults, little ceremony, and diagnostics that
   explain both the problem and the fix rather than only naming it. A feature
   present but hard to use correctly is not yet finished.
6. **Readability** — codegen and generated Rust are clear, well-named,
   maintainable. All else equal, the clearer form wins.

**The ordering is a strict tie-breaker, not a weighting:** at any conflicting
decision the higher-numbered principle yields — a faster path that opens a
soundness hole is rejected, a more readable form that breaks correctness is
rejected. A lower principle can never justify compromising a higher one.

## The fundamental technical rules

Beneath the ranked principles, every design and code pass obeys:

- **Parse, don't validate.** Convert untrusted/untyped input into a precise typed
  value ONCE at the boundary, so downstream code never re-encounters the
  unvalidated form. Foreign/JSON/config values enter through a typed decode
  point; error channels are typed (`Diagnostic`/`Error`), never `String`.
- **Make invalid states unrepresentable.** Encode invariants in types: a sum type
  over a bool-pair admitting impossible combinations; an exhaustive `match` (no
  wildcard that silently swallows a new variant); a smart constructor over an open
  field. A kernel the resolver recognises but the type-scheme table does not cover
  MUST be a compile-time error — never a silent flexible type variable that defers
  failure to the downstream Rust build. This is fail-closed by construction: with
  no proof the state is valid, the representable outcome is rejection, not a
  deferred blowup. A value's *role* lives in its type, never in a bare primitive
  another value of the same shape could stand in for: a message and a key are
  separate types so neither is passable for the other (as the runtime's crypto
  roles already are), and a position, a length, and a byte count are kept apart
  rather than shared as one integer. The swap that would otherwise compile — a
  secret where a plaintext belongs, a length used as an index — has no
  representation to begin with.
- **Fix the structure, not the symptom.** Repair the generative cause — the
  missing invariant, the drifting table, the untyped boundary, the special-case
  that should be a general rule — so the whole defect class cannot recur. Before
  writing a fix, ask "what structural property, if it held, would make this class
  of failure impossible?" and establish it. An ad-hoc patch that silences the
  visible symptom resurfaces one shape over (the next `match` arm, the next
  kernel, another call site). Example: coercing only inline-lambda sibling
  branches to the `Arc` carrier is ad-hoc — the identical `E0308` returns when the
  sibling is a top-level function reference; the structural fix eta-expands every
  function-typed leaf over the group's arrow type, closing the class.
- **Single source of truth.** Every fact — a colour, a version, a capability name,
  a kernel signature, a user-facing phrase — is defined in exactly one place.
  Where it must appear in a second form that cannot import the first (a shell
  script mirroring a Rust palette), generate one from the other or assert their
  equality in a test; never hand-sync. SSOT serves the precedence order: a
  one-line duplication caught by a test beats a leaky shared abstraction that hurts
  Correctness or Readability.
- **Defend in depth.** A security- or soundness-critical invariant is enforced at
  more than one independent boundary, so no single missed or bypassed check opens
  the hole. The safe surface never rests its guarantee on one gate: an identifier
  is validated where it is built AND again where it reaches SQL; the SEAL is
  re-checked at scheme, lowering, and emit; a row policy filters in the query AND
  in the database. Enforcing a critical invariant twice is not redundant waste —
  it is the margin that survives a single mistake.

The ordering says what wins in a conflict; these rules say how to build code that
doesn't create the conflict.

### The mandatory technical SEAL — no ipe-exit-0-then-cargo-fail

**If `ipe` accepts a program (exit 0), the emitted Rust MUST `cargo build`. Never
emit codegen that type-checks in ipe but fails cargo.** This is
make-invalid-states-unrepresentable applied to the pipeline itself: an
unschemed-but-resolved kernel, an arity table drifted from its callee table, a
generic where a concrete was required — each is a representable-but-illegal
pipeline state whose symptom is exit-0-then-cargo-fail. Every new acceptance path
(kernel, scheme, lowering arm, emitter case) fails closed at ipe time, never open
at cargo time.

Where two constants or two parallel tables must agree — an arity table with its
callee table, a diagnostic's code family with its prefix letter — assert that
agreement at build time (a `const` check, a type-level relation) so the instant
they drift the *build* breaks, not a test that can be skipped nor a cargo error
two steps downstream. A test guarding the agreement can be deleted; a build that
refuses to compile cannot.

### No shortcuts — root cause or honest blocker

Removing or skipping the file, example, test, fixture, golden, or line that
*triggers* a bug is NOT a fix — it hides it. NEVER edit a reference example,
fixture, or golden to dodge a compiler gap; never weaken a gate; never `#[allow]`
a real violation; never fake a seal. Exactly two acceptable outcomes for any
defect: **root-cause it**, or **report it honestly as a tracked blocker**. A
green obtained by deleting the red is a FAILURE.

- **Root causes only.** Never suppress a type error or warning; a defensive
  cover-up that hides a contract violation IS a violation.
- **Outcome ladder** (governs every change): clean → proceed; a principle is hurt
  → rethink and reimplement within the boundary; no adequate in-boundary fix
  exists → revert, log why, signal the user. Never ship a silent workaround.
- **No deferral.** "Pre-existing" / "known edge case" is never a shipping excuse:
  any bug surfacing during dev/sweep/CI/testing — introduced or pre-existing —
  enters the task pipeline on the spot. Only an explicit user override ("ship
  without fixing X") permits shipping a known unfixed issue.
- Every task is a means to the larger goal — making Ipê a better language for its
  developers and users. "Make the sweep green" means make the programs actually
  compile and run correctly, not make red rows disappear. When a shortcut would
  satisfy the literal ask but betray that goal, do the harder correct thing or
  surface the tradeoff — never take the shortcut silently.

### Prove the refusals

A suite that exercises only the happy path certifies half a feature. Pin every
path that must be *rejected* — the malformed input turned away, the fail-closed
branch taken, the value one step past the last legal one — because those are the
paths a regression or an attacker walks in on. A rejection that no test drives is
a rejection one edit away from vanishing unnoticed; the standing check on it is
what keeps it real.
