"""Drift gate for the CI check-disposition SSOT (ci/check-manifest.yml).

Fails (exit 1) when the manifest and reality disagree, so no check can exist
without a declared disposition and no `gate` can silently lose its producer.

Checks performed
  1. Every status context produced by .github/workflows/*.yml (matrix legs
     expanded) is present in the manifest.  An unclassified check is the exact
     "silent advisory red" this SSOT exists to forbid.
  2. Manifest self-consistency:
       - a known disposition (gate | nightly-gate | informational | delete);
       - `informational` entries name an `owner`;
       - an entry that `guards` a Security/Soundness/SEAL invariant is NOT
         `informational` (§0/§1/§3: a guarantee may not sit in an un-gated bucket);
       - a `gate`/`nightly-gate` entry has a producer workflow that exists;
       - a `delete` entry has no producer (an orphan), else it is a live check.
  3. Fail-closed dependency surfacing: GitHub reports a job whose `needs`
     failed as SKIPPED, and a skipped required check counts as passing.  So
     every job a gate transitively `needs` must itself surface in a gate (its
     own context is a gate, or a gate `aggregates` it); likewise a
     nightly-gate's ancestors must surface in a gate or nightly-gate.  A
     status context produced by two jobs is refused outright — a required
     context must resolve to exactly one producer.
  4. Required-set reconciliation (best-effort, non-fatal by default): every
     manifest `gate` context should be in the branch-protection required set and
     vice-versa.  Run with `--ruleset FILE` (a JSON dump of the ruleset's
     required contexts) to make mismatches fatal; without it the manifest is the
     SSOT and the check is skipped with a note.
  5. `ci/deterministic-checks.json` — the SSOT of (job, check step) pairs
     consumed by ci.yml's `cancel-on-cheap-red` watcher and
     rerun-failed-once.yml — is well-formed (exact keys, non-empty strings with
     no surrounding whitespace, no duplicate job), its job set equals the
     watcher's `needs:`, and each pair's step is a `name:` of that job's steps
     in ci.yml.

Pure stdlib + PyYAML (already a CI dependency).  No network.
