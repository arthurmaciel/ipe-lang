"""Drift gate for the CI check-disposition SSOT (ci/check-manifest.yml).

Fails (exit 1) when the manifest and reality disagree, so no check can exist
without a declared disposition and no `gate` can silently lose its producer.

Checks performed
  1. Every status context produced by .github/workflows/*.yml or *.yaml
     (matrix legs expanded) is present in the manifest.  An unclassified
     check is the exact "silent advisory red" this SSOT exists to forbid.
  2. Manifest self-consistency:
       - a known disposition (gate | nightly-gate | informational | delete);
       - `informational` entries name an `owner`;
       - an entry that `guards` a Security/Soundness/SEAL invariant is NOT
         `informational` (§0/§1/§3: a guarantee may not sit in an un-gated bucket);
       - a `gate`/`nightly-gate` entry has a producer workflow that exists;
       - a `delete` entry has no producer (an orphan), else it is a live check.
  3. Fail-closed dependency surfacing: GitHub reports a job whose `needs`
     failed as SKIPPED, and a skipped required check counts as passing.  So
     every job a gate transitively `needs` must itself surface in a gate (its
     own context is a gate, or a gate `aggregates` it); likewise a
     nightly-gate's ancestors must surface in a gate or nightly-gate.  A
     status context produced by two jobs is refused outright — a required
     context must resolve to exactly one producer.
  4. Required-set reconciliation (best-effort, non-fatal by default): every
     manifest `gate` context should be in the branch-protection required set and
     vice-versa.  Run with `--ruleset FILE` (a JSON dump of the ruleset's
     required contexts) to make mismatches fatal; without it the manifest is the
     SSOT and the check is skipped with a note.
  5. `ci/deterministic-checks.json` — the SSOT of (job, check step) pairs
     consumed by ci.yml's `cancel-on-cheap-red` watcher — is well-formed (exact keys, non-empty strings with
     no surrounding whitespace, no duplicate job), its job set equals the
     watcher's `needs:`, and each pair's step is a `name:` of that job's steps
     in ci.yml.
  6. rustc wiring and cache hygiene: no job wraps or replaces rustc, so
     every build compiles with the pinned toolchain's own rustc and no cache
     stands between the source and the artifact a gate vouches for. Every
     local `./` `uses:` (step or composite step) is resolved on disk
     (action.yml, then action.yaml) under a normalized, byte-exact id; an
     unresolved, ambiguous, case-variant, non-composite, cyclic, or
     over-deep local action is refused, as is a job-level `uses:` (reusable
     workflow). Refused anywhere: an `env:` key naming a rustc wrapper or a
     rustc replacement at any scope; any `env:` value, `run:`, `shell:`,
     `defaults.run.shell`, or `with:` text naming one (or cargo's
     `rustc-wrapper` config spelling), or assembling its target through a
     GitHub Actions expression function (`format(`, `join(`, `toJSON(`, or
     `fromJSON(` over a literal; any letter case) instead of naming it
     literally; and a `Swatinem/rust-cache` step whose `with.save-if` is not
     exactly `RUST_CACHE_SAVE_IF`, so only `main` writes the dependency cache
     and a pull request run restores it without evicting it. Every workflow,
     manifest, and local action is loaded through `strict_yaml` (see that
     module), so a duplicate mapping key, a `<<` merge key, an anchor/alias,
     or an explicit tag — each legal to a plain YAML loader but resolved
     differently, or not at all, from what GitHub Actions runs — is refused
     rather than silently resolved. Malformed shapes are refused, never
skipped. Limits are listed on `check_workflow_steps`. Likewise mold is
     installed only through `./.github/actions/mold`, which checks the pinned
     release digest; a raw `rui314/setup-mold` reference is refused.
  7. CI inputs and runner command files, over the same traversal as check 6:
     every third-party `uses:` is pinned to a 40-hex commit SHA (a `docker://`
     reference, and every job `container:`/`services:` image, to a sha256
     digest); pip installs only as the one canonical command
     `CANONICAL_PIP_INSTALL` (`PIP_CONFIG_FILE=/dev/null`, `--isolated`,
     `--require-hashes --only-binary :all: -r` the hashed requirements file),
     parsed into a `PipInvocation` and compared whole, with every other
     `PIP_*` name, pip config file, and non-pip installer refused; and the
     runner env file is written only through
     `ci/github-env.sh`, called in a step's `run:` in its one canonical form
     with a bare `CI_JOB_*` key listed in `ci/github-env-allowlist.txt`. Every
     string key and value of every workflow, job, step, and local action is
     scanned by one matcher: any spelling (any case, `$VAR`, `${VAR}`,
     `env.VAR`, an env key) of GITHUB_ENV/PATH/STATE/OUTPUT/STEP_SUMMARY, their
     on-disk command files, or the legacy `::set-env`/`::add-path`/
     `::save-state`/`::set-output` commands is refused, save an append to
     GITHUB_OUTPUT/GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY by its exact name; inside an expression
     the `github`/`env` contexts are read only through a literal `.name`
     that is not a command-file property (`github.env`, `github['env']`,
     `toJSON(github)` are refused); and `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` is only ever read,
     never assigned. Every `${{ }}` body is parsed by `gha_expr`'s typed
     grammar (a `}}` inside a string literal does not end it; a body outside
     the grammar is refused). A `shell:` (step or `defaults.run.shell`) is
     one of bash/pwsh/powershell, bare. In a step's `run:`, an expression
     holds no string literal and never abuts a shell variable name; no shell
     function or alias is defined; and pip is matched on quote-removed words
     (`shell_lex`). The integrity of `.github/ci/**` itself rests on an
     ordering rule: a step naming the tree is itself a closed pre-tool shape
     and runs only after steps of one (a content-pinned checkout or
     setup-python with a closed literal `with:` and no `env:`, the canonical
     pip install with no `env:`, a typed `ToolRun` of a file that exists
     under `.github/ci`, its words split only on bash's blanks
     `shell_lex.BLANKS`; any `timeout-minutes` a positive integer literal).
     The job is parsed once into a `ToolJob`: a literal GitHub-hosted Ubuntu
     runner (a fresh machine per job), job keys from one closed allowlist
     (`TOOL_JOB_KEYS`: no container, services, strategy, concurrency, or
     environment), every `env:` key at workflow, job, and tool-step scope
     drawn from one allowlist (`TOOL_ENV_ALLOWLIST`), and a masking key
     (`MASKING_KEYS`: `if:`, `continue-on-error:`) on a step or on the job
     only where every tool's `ToolRole` admits it (`ROLE_MASKING`): a
     verdict tool admits none, an advisory tool's step a literal
     `continue-on-error: true`, an output tool's terminal job an `if:`. A
     job whose tool admits no job masking (verdict, advisory) also admits no
     `needs:`, so no skipped ancestor can skip it. No `working-directory` anywhere names
     `.github`. A quote-removed scan refusing writes into the tree is
     defence in depth under that rule, not its proof. The ordering rule and
     that scan guard a checked-out tree, so neither's step half applies to a
     head-free workflow (`head_free`: one check 12a admits), whose workspace
     never holds a checkout (no `uses:` anywhere, no `git`) and whose every
     command is its own `run:` text; its tree-naming jobs are still held to
     the `ToolJob` job half as verdict jobs (no masking key, no `needs:`),
     and every other rule of this check still applies to them.
  8. Merge-queue safety: every producer of a `gate` context triggers on both
     `pull_request` and `merge_group`, else the queue waits forever on a
     required context no merge-group run reports.  A merge-group run gets the
     base repository's secrets and token, so every `merge_group`-triggered
     workflow must be secret-free (no `secrets` word in its raw text, nor in
     any key or string scalar once parsed, which decodes escapes), may also
     trigger on `pull_request_target` only when check 12 admits it, and must
     declare a top-level
     `permissions:` value with no `write` scope.  A job-level `write` scope is
     admitted only on a job whose `if:` has no `||` and has, among its
     `&&`-conjuncts at parenthesis depth 0, exactly
     `github.event_name == 'pull_request'`.  A bare
     `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` full-tier test (either operand
     order) must be followed by `&& github.event_name != 'merge_group'`, so a
     merge-group run takes the PR tier rather than silently running the full
     tier.
     Limit: this catches honest mistakes, not a hostile PR.  A merge-group run
     executes the workflow files of the queued commit, so a queued PR that
     edits `.github/**` runs its own edit with the base secrets.  The boundary
     is who may enqueue: only write-access maintainers, who review every
     `.github/**` diff before enqueueing.
  9. No release-only skip-as-pass: GitHub reports a skipped job as a passing
     status, so a `gate` context may go green only through an executed step.
     A `gate` producer's job-level `if:` may name `release_only` only as one
     top-level `||` disjunct `needs.<job>.outputs.release_only == 'true'`
     (forcing the job to run on a release-please PR), and such a job's first
     step must be the trivial-pass step: `if:` exactly that disjunct, with a
     `run:`.  Any other mention (`!= 'true'`, a negation, an `&&`-conjunct,
     an unparseable expression) is refused, as is the release-only disjunct
     with no leading trivial-pass step (every step skipped also reports a
     pass).  GitHub resolves context properties case-insensitively, so the
     name is matched without case, and a job output that re-exports
     `release_only` (to any depth) counts as `release_only`.  A `gate`
     producer whose every step carries an `if:` is held to the same
     trivial-pass shape whatever the steps test, since its steps can all skip.
  10. Fast gate first: in ci.yml, every heavy test-shard job (a matrix job
      that downloads the `nextest-archive` artifact; `test-run` and `e2e` must
      be among them) `needs` every fast deterministic gate (FAST_GATES), and
      its `if:` calls no status function (`always()`, `failure()`,
      `cancelled()`) that would start it behind a red need.  Each fast gate is
      a single unexpanded ci.yml job, a manifest `gate`, and `needs` nothing
      but `changes`, so it stays fast.  A format, lint, lock or panic-scan red
      therefore never launches the heavy tier on any event or fork.
  12. Gate integrity.  (a) A `pull_request_target` run holds the base
      repository's token beside a PR author's input, so every workflow
      triggering on it must provably run no head code: no `uses:` at step or
      job level (no checkout, no action at all), no `git`, no `gh` other
      than `gh api`, no `secrets` word, no word naming the PR head (`head`,
      `merge_commit_sha`, `refs/pull/`; any letter case, in the raw text, in
      any parsed key or scalar, or in its shell commands' quote-removed
      words, so `g""it` is `git`), no `${{ }}` expression other than
      `github.token`, and a top-level `permissions:` value with no `write`
      scope at the top or on any job.  A workflow (a) admits is head-free
      (`head_free`, the one predicate checks 7 and 8 read): its workspace
      never holds a checkout, so check 7's step ordering and write scan do
      not apply to it.  (b) `.github/CODEOWNERS` is the trust-root SSOT: it
      must parse under `trust_roots.py`'s accepted subset, every rule must
      match at least one tracked file, the trust-root machinery
      (`CODEOWNERS`, `trust_roots.py`, this verifier, `trust-root-diff.yml`)
      and every tracked file under `.github/` (workflows, actions, and the
      helpers the verifiers import) must be a trust root, every tracked
      script a workflow or local action names by path must be a trust root,
      and no second CODEOWNERS file may exist at the root or in `docs/`.  A
      workflow whose `on:` has no recognised shape but names
      `pull_request_target` is refused by (a).
      Limit: (a) is a text audit that catches honest mistakes (a fetch of
      head content spelled without a head word, such as a `curl` of a URL
      assembled at run time, is not seen, and check 7's head-free exemption
      rests on the same audit); a hostile edit to a workflow is a
      `.github/**` change, which (b) makes code-owned.
  13. Push concurrency: GitHub keeps at most one queued run per concurrency
      group and replaces it when a newer run joins, whatever
      `cancel-in-progress` says, so a group two pushes to one branch share
      lets a newer commit discard an older one's run before it starts.  Every
      push-triggered workflow's workflow- and job-level `group` is evaluated
      for two pushes to the same branch (distinct `github.sha` and
      `github.run_id`) and must differ.  The evaluator reads string, boolean
      and null literals and a closed set of `github` properties with `==`,
      `!=`, `&&`, `||` and `!`; any other context, function, number literal
      or mixed-type comparison is refused.  `LATEST_WINS_PUSH_GROUPS` names the workflows whose run acts on the
      branch head it reads at run time, each with its reason, and every entry
      must be a push-triggered workflow.

Pure stdlib + PyYAML (already a CI dependency).  No network; check 12 runs
`git ls-files` locally to list tracked paths.

          job, and tool-step `env:` key is a `ToolEnvKey` of

          GitHub-hosted Ubuntu label (`RunnerLabel`), a job key outside
          `TOOL_JOB_KEYS`, a `timeout-minutes` that is not a positive integer
          literal (`Timeout`), a masking key its tools' roles do not admit,
          a job `if:` on a job another job needs, a `needs:` on a job with a
          VERDICT or ADVISORY step (a skipped ancestor, anywhere up the `needs:` chain,
          skips it too, and a skipped required check reports success), a
          `working-directory` at step or defaults scope, or a
          `defaults.run.shell` other than bash is refused. In every job, a
          `working-directory` (step, composite

          component, as written (`\\` read as `/`) or resolved on disk, is
          refused: a relative `ci/...` under it names the tree unspelled.
          The raw-text scan reads `\\` as `/`. The canonical
          `ci/github-env.sh` call is not a reference: a step after a
          non-closed step already runs arbitrary code with the env file
          open, so the helper grants it nothing, and the helper is not a
          verdict. A composite step naming the tree is refused (it runs
          wherever the action is used). Beneath (i), a quote-removed scan
          (brace expansion, wrapper flags, `xargs`, `sh -c` text, and a
          shell fed unseen standard input all resolved) refuses a write into
          the tree as defence in depth. Both guard a checked-out tree: in a
          head-free workflow (`Workspace.NONE`, from `head_free`) no step
          or job `uses:` anything and nothing runs `git`, so no checkout
          exists; there only the job half of (i) is asked, the job read as
          a verdict job (`ToolJob.parse`), and the write scan is not run.
    Every local `uses: ./...` is resolved on disk from the repo root
    (`action.yml`, then `action.yaml`); an unresolvable, ambiguous, non-
    composite (node/docker), cyclic, or over-deep (> LOCAL_ACTION_DEPTH_LIMIT)
    reference is refused. Identity is the normalized, byte-exact path: a
    reference, or any entry under `.github/actions/` referenced or not, that
    is case-fold-equal to another path but not byte-equal is refused. A
    job-level `uses:` (reusable workflow, local or remote) is refused. A
    malformed shape (`jobs:`, `steps:`, a job, a step, `env:`, `defaults:`,
    `container:`, `services:`) is refused, never skipped.

    LIMIT — static YAML cannot see, and this check does NOT prove absent:
      - a third-party action that itself exports a wrapper into the job, or
        a cache action other than `Swatinem/rust-cache` that saves from a
        pull request ref;
      - a repo script or interpreter snippet invoked from `run:` (`run:
        tools/ci/wire.sh`, `python -c ...`) that writes a wrapper or the env
        file under a name it assembles at run time, or a package manager
        (npm, cargo, apt, docker) fetching by a movable name;
      - an `env:`/`with:` value whose key name arrives only through `${{ }}`
        (`vars`, `secrets`, outputs);
      - a rustc replacement outside the named keys (a `PATH` entry shadowing
        `rustc`, a `rustup` toolchain override, a linker/runner setting);
      - run-time string assembly inside `run:` that builds a command-file
        name or a command the text scan never sees whole: `eval`, a
        variable name concatenated from parts, `${!x}` indirection, a glob
        over the runner temp directory, a decoded payload piped to a shell;
      - what a step writes into GITHUB_OUTPUT (content, a multiline
        delimiter) and how later `${{ steps.*.outputs.* }}` interpolation
        uses it;
      - an expression value that is itself shell text (`${{ inputs.f }}`
        whose value is `$GITHUB_ENV`), and interpreter variables (`PYTHON*`)
        that steer the canonical pip install;
      - shadowing a checked command by means other than a shell function or
        alias written in the same `run:` (a `PATH` entry, `BASH_ENV`, a
        sourced file);
      - under (i), a runner that carries a GitHub-hosted label but is not
        one: the label test assumes the repository registers no self-hosted
        runner (it registers none; one labelled `ubuntu-latest` would keep
        its disk across jobs); a step that runs the tree spelled so no word
        names it (`${d}hub/ci`, a relative path after `cd .github`, a
        pure-wildcard `.*/ci`) is not seen as a tool step, so its verdict is
        not one this rule vouches for; and, for the same reason, a symlink
        to the tree created at run time by an unrecognised step earlier in
        the same job (a hosted runner is a fresh machine per job, so no
        other job's link survives into it) and then run through a path no
        word spells as the tree;
      - in the defence-in-depth write scan beneath (i) (these are closed
        only because (i) refuses the tool after any such step): a path the
        words do not spell (`d=.git; ${d}hub/ci`, a relative path after
        `cd`), an interpreter snippet, an archive extractor, `find -exec`,
        a whole-tree `git checkout`/`git reset`, an action's `with:`, and
        pwsh text (lexed as POSIX);
      - an attacker-controlled `${{ github.event.* }}` value interpolated
        straight into `run:` text (passing it through `env:` is the safe form);
      - a legacy `::set-env` command assembled by the shell at run time (the
        quote-concatenated `::set-""env` spelling is refused);
      - installers that fetch without pip's hash checking beyond the refused
        `setup.py install`, `uv pip`, `uv tool`, `uvx`, `pipx`, and
        `easy_install`;
      - `TOOL_FLAG_RE` admits any literal flag word, so `--help`/`-h` is an
        accepted tool invocation and exits 0 without running the tool's
        verdict logic;
      - a `.py`/`.sh` file under the tree is accepted as a tool by its
        filename suffix alone — a library module never meant to run
        standalone (`strict_yaml.py`, `release_only.py`) parses the same as
        a verdict script;
      - `run: true` (or any non-`run:` step form) is not a `ToolRun` and so
        is not a tool step at all — it neither names the tree nor is
        refused for failing to;
      - nothing here binds a branch-protection required context's name to
        the tool file it is meant to report; the mapping from context to
        script is trusted, not checked.
    Those are review-gated, not machine-gated.
