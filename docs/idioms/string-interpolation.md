# String interpolation over `++`

**The idiom:** when you build a string out of several pieces of text and values,
reach for a triple-quoted string with `{{…}}` interpolation, not a long `++`
chain. The interpolated form reads as the text it produces; the `++` chain reads
as plumbing.

## The shape

A `"""…"""` string spans multiple lines and its source indentation is stripped,
so you lay the text out where it is written without that layout leaking into the
value. Inside it, `{{expr}}` substitutes a value — auto-stringified through
`Basics.toString`, so an `Int` needs no `String.fromInt`.

A gnarly concatenation like this:

```ipe ipe:skip
"Deploying " ++ service ++ " v" ++ String.fromInt version ++ " to " ++ region ++ "\n"
```

becomes one readable interpolated string:

```ipe
summary : String -> Int -> String -> String
summary service version region =
    """
    Deploying {{service}} v{{version}} to {{region}}
    """
```

Both produce the same text. The interpolated form puts the values where they
land in the output, and `{{version}}` stringifies the `Int` on its own.

## Only simple references interpolate

An interpolation body is one of four simple shapes: a bare identifier
`{{name}}`, a field access `{{record.field}}`, a qualified name
`{{Module.value}}`, or a single application `{{fn arg}}`. Anything more complex
stays as literal `{{…}}` text — so compute it into a `let` binding first and
interpolate the name:

```ipe
line : Int -> Int -> String
line done total =
    let
        pct = done * 100 // total
    in
    """
    progress: {{pct}}%
    """
```

## When not to reach for it

Interpolation lives **only** in triple-quoted strings; in a single-line `"…"`
string `{{x}}` is literal text. For a short one-piece string with no
substitution, a plain `"…"` is clearest — the idiom pays off once you are
stitching text and values together.
