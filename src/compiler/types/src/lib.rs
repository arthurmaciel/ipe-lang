#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! `ipe_types` — Hindley-Milner type inference for the supported subset of
//! Ipê.
//!
//! Entry point: [`infer`]. It consumes a name-resolved [`ipe_canon::ast::Module`]
//! and produces a [`SolvedTypes`] carrying (a) the inferred type of every
//! top-level binding (`env`) and (b) the inferred type of every sub-expression
//! source region (`regions`) — the latter being exactly what the type-directed
//! lowerer reads to fill its `IrType` slots.
//!
//! The implementation is a faithful but narrowed port of the Haskell compiler's
//! `Ipe.Type.{Type,UnionFind,Unify,Solve}` + `Constrain.Expression`:
//!
//! * [`unionfind`] — `Vec`-backed weighted union-find (port of `UnionFind`).
//! * [`constrain`] — constraint generation over the canonical AST (the
//!   supported arms of `Constrain.Expression`).
//! * [`unify`] — in-place unification with an occurs check (port of `Unify`).
//! * [`solve`] — budget-bounded constraint discharge (port of `Solve`).
//!
//! ## Interner mutability
//! [`infer`] takes `&mut Interner`. The type checker must *name* built-in type
//! constructors that never appear in user source — notably `Task` (the result
//! of `println`). Minting their [`Symbol`]s requires interning, exactly as the
//! sibling pipeline stages (`parse_module`, `canonicalise`) already take
//! `&mut Interner`. The freshly-interned names flow downstream so the lowerer
//! (which keeps `&Interner`) can resolve them.

/// Discharge every deferred record field access (`record.field`).
///
/// By the time this runs the main solve has settled each record's type. For each
/// access, the now-resolved record type is read: a closed record carrying the
/// field links the access's result variable to the field's type (so any
/// surrounding constraint already placed on the result, e.g. `record.field + 1`,
/// is checked against the field's real type); a record without the field — or a
/// base that is not a record at all — is a [`TypeError::NoSuchField`] blamed at
/// the access span.
///
/// # Ordering / fixpoint pass
///
/// Field accesses can depend on each other: `m.status` is only resolvable after
/// `model.monitors` has been resolved (which then unifies `m` with `Monitor`
/// via `List.filter`'s element-type propagation). A single left-to-right pass
/// over the access list would fail whenever a dependent access appears before its
/// provider. The function therefore iterates to a fixpoint: each pass processes
/// every access whose record variable has already settled to a concrete record;
/// `Flex` vars are deferred for the next pass. The loop terminates because each
/// pass that makes progress resolves at least one access, strictly shrinking the
/// pending set. When a full pass makes no progress, the remaining accesses carry
/// record variables that genuinely could not be pinned — reported as errors.
/// Discharge deferred field accesses and record updates in a joint fixpoint.
///
/// ## Why a joint loop is required
///
/// Field accesses (`snap.ok`) and record updates (`{ model | history = snapshots }`)
/// can form dependency chains where a record update pins the element type of a
/// list field that a downstream field access then needs.  Running the two passes
/// sequentially breaks this: if field accesses run first the element type is still
/// `Flex`, `snap.ok` stalls, and a false [`TypeError::NoSuchField`] (IPE-T0012)
/// is reported.
///
/// Concrete example (example 18 `job-queue`):
/// * `init` produces `{ …, history = [] }` — `history : List[v_flex]`.
/// * `HistoryLoaded (Ok snapshots)` arm does `{ model | history = snapshots }` where
///   `snapshots : List Snapshot` — this **record update** pins `v_flex = Snapshot`.
/// * `viewSnapshot snap = … snap.ok …` — this **field access** needs `v_flex` to
///   be settled to `Snapshot` before it can resolve.
///
/// ## Algorithm
///
/// Each iteration processes ALL pending field accesses and ALL pending record
/// updates:
/// * If the base var is `Flex` → defer to the next iteration.
/// * If the base is a settled record that has the field → discharge (call [`unify`]);
///   mark `made_progress = true`.
/// * If the base is a settled record that is **missing** the field, or is not a
///   record at all → return an immediate [`TypeError::NoSuchField`].
///
/// The loop terminates when both pending lists are empty (success) or when an
/// entire iteration makes no progress while items remain (stuck — emit the first
/// item as the error).
/// The fixed field set of the opaque server `Request` type.
///
/// The reference models `Ipe.Http.Server.Request` as a `type alias` over a
/// closed record `{ method, path, body, headers, params, query, cookies,

/// carries `Request` as an opaque nullary `Con` (it threads through kernel
/// signatures — `Server.get`, `Server.param`, the `Handler` alias — as an
/// opaque handle, and the lowerer maps it to `IrType::ServerRequest` backed by
