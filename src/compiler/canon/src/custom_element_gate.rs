//! Widget-file collection for the `CustomElement.fromFile "<js-path>"` constructor.
//!
//! The constructor's shape gate (single string literal) and its path seal (an
//! all-targets clean + traversal check, reusing `ipe_path_core`) run in canon,
//! where they are pure. The remaining check — that the named JS file actually EXISTS
//! inside the project root — needs the filesystem and the project root, which the
//! salsa canon queries deliberately do not touch (a query keyed on source text
//! must stay a pure function of that text). So this module only COLLECTS the
//! cleaned path of every constructor in a linked program, each with its span; the
//! build stage that owns the project root turns a missing file into the
//! fail-closed IPE-N0044 (Security #5: a widget cannot register against a file
//! that is not there).
//!
//! By construction a `CustomElementCtor` node appears only as the whole body of a
//! `CustomElement`-annotated binding (`resolve::detect_custom_element_constructor`
//! is the sole mint site), but this walk is exhaustive over the expression tree
//! anyway — defence in depth, so a future node placement cannot slip past the
//! existence check.
