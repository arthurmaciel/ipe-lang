//! Decoder-pipeline direction gate: reject the hand-nested form of the
//! `required` / `optional` / `requiredAt` / `custom` decoder combinators.
//!
//! The `Db.Decode` and `Json.Decode.Pipeline` combinators thread a decoder
//! accumulator as their LAST argument, so the idiomatic spelling is a `|>`
//! pipe:
//!
//! ```ipe
//! Db.Decode.succeed User
//!     |> Db.Decode.required "name" Db.Decode.string
//!     |> Db.Decode.required "email" Db.Decode.string
//! ```
//!
//! Read top-to-bottom, the fields bind to the constructor in source order.
//! Hand-nesting the same calls REVERSES that order — the innermost call binds
//! to the constructor first:
//!
//! ```ipe
//! Db.Decode.required "name" Db.Decode.string
//!     (Db.Decode.required "email" Db.Decode.string
//!         (Db.Decode.succeed User))
//! ```
//!
//! Here `email` reaches the constructor before `name`. When two fields share a
//! type this silently swaps them with NO type error — a `User name email`
//! decodes into `User email name`. The gate makes that footgun a compile error
//! (IPE-N0040) whose message shows the correct `|>` rewrite.
//!
//! ## What is detected
//!
//! A [`Expr_::Call`] is a *fully-applied family call* when its head is a bare
//! [`Expr_::VarKernel`] of one of the six family kernels AND its argument count
//! equals that kernel's declared arity. Its accumulator is the LAST argument.
//! The gate rejects a fully-applied family call whose accumulator RESOLVES to
//! another fully-applied family call — either directly nested, or reached
//! through a `let`-bound or top-level binder (the binder-indirection the
//! idiomatic pipe never produces).
//!
//! ## Why the pipe form is untouched (no false positives)
//!
//! `x |> f` desugars to `Call(f, [x])` (`resolve::resolve_binop`). A pipe
//! stage `acc |> Db.Decode.required "name" da` therefore becomes
//! `Call(Call(VarKernel required, ["name", da]), [acc])`: the OUTER call's head
//! is a `Call`, not a bare `VarKernel`, so it is never a fully-applied family
//! call and never inspected. The inner `Call(VarKernel required, ["name", da])`
//! is under-applied (2 args, arity 3), so it is not one either. Only the
//! literally hand-nested spelling — a bare-kernel head applied to its full
//! arity, threading another such call as its accumulator — matches.
