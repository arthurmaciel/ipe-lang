//! Stable error codes (`IPE-XNNNN`) and their metadata.
//!
//! Every [`crate::Diagnostic`] maps to exactly one [`Code`] via
//! [`crate::Diagnostic::code`]. Codes are the machine-greppable, user-facing
//! handle a reader passes to `ipe explain <CODE>`; they never change once
//! shipped. The taxonomy is authoritative here (this file + the explain
//! pages under `crates/ipe_diagnostics/explain/`); the original design spec
//! is preserved in git history.
//!
//! Ranges: `IPE-P####` parse, `IPE-N####` name resolution, `IPE-T####` type,
//! `IPE-L####` lower / not-yet-supported, `IPE-F####` foreign bindings (FFI),
//! `IPE-I####` internal (compiler bug).
//!
//! Single source of truth: the [`code!`] table below declares every code once,
//! pairing its wire string with its one-line title and its `ipe explain` page.
//! [`ALL_CODES`], [`title`], and [`explain_page`] are all generated from that
//! one table, so a code cannot exist in one and be missing from another, and
//! the taxonomy size is derived by counting rows — never a hand-pinned literal.
//! Adding a code is one table row (plus its `explain/<CODE>.md`); see [`code!`].
