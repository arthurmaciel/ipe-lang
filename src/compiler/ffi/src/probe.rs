//! The Tier-2 link-reachability probe emitter.
//!
//! Tier-2 admission ([`crate::audit_native`] in `ipe-cli`, ADR 0046) must build
//! and link a native-bearing package's OWN foreign surface under a jail scoped
//! to its declared capability set, so a build-time capability reach (a
//! `build.rs`, proc-macro, linker script, or `bindgen` fetch inside a bound
//! crate) is observed as a denial. Linking alone under-observes: the linker
//! dead-strips any wrapper nothing references, taking that wrapper's transitive
//! foreign call — and its build-time reach — with it.
//!
//! This module emits a probe `main` that REFERENCES every surviving wrapper so
//! the linker must retain the whole foreign surface. The reference is an
//! address-of into an opaque sink ([`std::hint::black_box`]); the probe NEVER
//! invokes a wrapper with fabricated inputs — that would run unbounded author
//! logic and cannot synthesise a valid opaque receiver anyway. What is confined
//! is the *build and link* of the package's real surface, never a stand-in whose
//! actions Tier-2 chose.
//!
//! ## Single source of the exercised surface
//!
//! The probe references exactly the wrappers the app crate actually emitted into
//! `src/ffi.rs` — the DCE-trimmed foreign surface the artifact ships. The caller
//! (`audit_native`) reads that emitted set and passes it to [`emit_probe_main`],
//! so the probe's surface is the shipped surface by construction: never wider (a
//! phantom reference would fail to link) and never narrower (an omitted wrapper
//! would let its build-time reach go un-exercised). The package cannot author a
//! narrower probe — it does not write the probe at all.
//!
//! [`surviving_wrapper_paths`] maps the binding-DCE survivor set through the SAME
//! [`crate::naming::wrapper_fn_ident`] the emitter names its `pub fn`s with; it is
//! the reference computation of a bound crate's full wrapper path set, kept for
//! callers that need the untrimmed surface.
