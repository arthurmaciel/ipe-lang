#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Backend-agnostic typed intermediate representation for the Ipê compiler.
//! This is the single boundary every backend consumes: the frontend lowers
//! into [`Program`], backends read it and emit code. No frontend type leaks
//! across this line.
//!
//! Illegal states are unrepresentable. In particular, a
//! [`Match`] is exhaustive by construction — the only way to build one is
//! [`Match::new`], which verifies the arm set covers exactly the scrutinee's
//! enum variants and returns [`ipe_diagnostics::Diagnostic::CompilerBug`]
//! otherwise. A backend that receives a [`Program`] never has to re-check
//! exhaustiveness.
