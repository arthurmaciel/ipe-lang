//! End-to-end proof of the returning build jail + the per-axis differential
//! confinement contract — the Tier-2 observation primitive at the kernel
//! boundary.
//!
//! These are REAL jailed runs (they spawn `bwrap`) of the admission probe
//! fixture (`tests/fixtures/admission/untrusted-build.sh`, `PROBE_MODE=tier2`),
//! so they are gated behind `IPE_E2E=1` and skip cleanly when the jail cannot be
//! established here — either because bubblewrap / the cap helpers are absent, or
//! because the environment forbids establishing the jail (a locked-down runner
//! where `bwrap` is present but the kernel denies the namespace setup). A
//! one-time canary (`/bin/true` under the most-isolated profile) settles this;
//! the tests early-return exactly as they do when the tools are missing, never a
//! false pass.
//!
//! What they prove directly at the OS boundary, not by the payload's own choice:
//!
//! - **Denied names the axis.** Under a jail scoped to a DECLARED set that
//!   withholds `network`, the probe's socket attempt is denied → the fixture's
//!   wrapper-owned exit code decodes to [`JailOutcome::Denied`] naming
//!   `network`. Likewise an out-of-scratch write under a filesystem-withholding
//!   jail decodes to `Denied { filesystem }`.
//! - **Clean requires positive proof.** A benign in-scratch write under the
//!   declared-scoped jail exits 0 → [`JailOutcome::Clean`]. The one admit-eligible
//!   outcome only ever comes from the probe's clean exit.
