//! Inert `update`-arm transitions: the logic counterpart of the appearance
//! [`super::literal_table`], for the subset of `update` arms whose effect on the
//! `Model` is a single data-describable field change.
//!
//! # The mechanism (mirrors the literal table exactly)
//!
//! An `update` arm like `Increment -> { m | count = count + 1 }` describes one
//! field change with no control flow, no `Cmd`, no function call. The compiler
//! reduces such an arm to an inert [`Transition`] datum (a target field, a small
//! closed [`TransitionOp`], and an inert [`Source`]) and emits the arm as a call
//! to the ONE compiled [`apply_transition`] routine over that baked datum. Prod
//! holds only the baked datum, so the arm runs exactly what a direct compiled
//! arm would — one update semantics, dev == prod. In dev an edit to a simple arm
//! ships a new datum over the live socket; the running program swaps the baked
//! datum and the SAME [`apply_transition`] produces the next `Model`, with no
//! recompile.
//!
//! # Why operate on the JSON object (the whole soundness argument)
//!
//! At runtime the `Model` is an opaque generic struct; the routine has no static
//! knowledge of a field name as a Rust ident. It instead works on the `Model`'s
//! self-describing JSON object (`serde_json::to_value`) exactly as
//! [`super::additive`] does: read the named field, apply the closed op, write it
//! back, then STRICT-decode the merged object into the real `Model`. That strict
//! decode is the fail-closed backstop — a datum that does not describe a
//! well-typed change (wrong field, type mismatch, arithmetic that would not
//! type-check) fails to decode and [`apply_transition`] returns the model
//! UNCHANGED, never a torn or coerced `Model`.
//!
//! # Inert + bounded + fail-closed
//!
//! A [`Transition`] carries only: a field NAME (a string), one of a small closed
//! set of [`TransitionOp`]s, and a [`Source`] that is a literal or the named
//! field itself. It has no code, no call, no nesting — [`apply_transition`]
//! cannot run arbitrary logic, cannot panic/unwrap/index/overflow (integer ops
//! are checked and REFUSE on overflow, returning the input model), and refuses
//! (returns the input model unchanged) anything it cannot prove applies: a
//! missing field, a type mismatch, a non-object model, an oversized model, or a
//! strict-decode failure. The dev patch channel is untrusted; every failure is a
//! total no-op that leaves the caller's `Model` exactly as it was.

// The running web app owns each data-describable `update` arm through the
// emitted `apply_transition_hot` call, which rebuilds a `Transition` from the
// baked datum's JSON on every dispatch. To hot-swap a simple arm (a `+1` → `+2`,
// a `Set` literal, a toggle target) without a recompile, the dev control path
// registers a replacement `Transition` keyed by the arm's *baked-datum
// signature* (the exact JSON the compiler baked, in emit form); the next
// `apply_transition_hot` for that signature applies the replacement instead of
// the baked datum, so the next `update` produces the edited transition's Model.
//
// Keying by the baked JSON (rather than a single global patch) confines an edit
// to the one arm whose datum it describes: a second arm with a different baked
// datum never sees it. The baked datum string is a compile-time constant, so the
// signature stays stable across dispatches.
//
// The overlay is inert unless [`dev_transition_active`] holds (flag on AND
// non-production). It shares the appearance overlay's `IPE_WATCH_HOT_APPEARANCE`
// gate — one dev-overlay switch for the whole program-as-data surface. In a
// production build the flag is off and the dev control path is never mounted, so

// The overlay + its gate are process-global, so these tests serialise on the

// the registry on the way out. Each proves the dev == prod crux at the reader
// seam: with the overlay OFF, `apply_transition_hot` is byte-identical to
// decoding + applying the baked datum; with it ON, a registered replacement
// swaps the arm's effect with no recompile.
