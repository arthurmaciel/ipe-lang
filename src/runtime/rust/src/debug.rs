//! `Ipe.Debug` — the development-only escape hatch.
//!
//! `Debug.log label value` prints `"<label>: <value>"` to stderr as a side
//! effect and returns `value` UNCHANGED, so it can be spliced into any
//! expression without altering its result. The value is stringified through the
//! same total `IpeStringify` path `Basics.toString` / `{{expr}}` interpolation
//! uses, so any Ipê-representable value renders (a `String` unquoted, scalars
//! like  `%v`, records/ADTs via their codegen-emitted impl).
//!
//! This is the ONE deliberate impure escape hatch in the language — NOT a
//! `Task`. `ipe release` rejects any `Debug.*` use at compile time (IPE-L0140),
//! so this function is only ever reached from a development build.
