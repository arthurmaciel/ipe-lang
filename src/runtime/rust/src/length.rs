//! The shared CSS length-unit renderer — the single place the `<n><unit>`
//! spelling is produced for every Ipê surface.
//!
//! `Ipe.Ui.Length` and `Ipe.Css.Length` are two distinct surface types (layout
//! intent vs typography), deliberately not merged. They share exactly the
//! `Px`/`Vh`/`Vw` shapes — an integer magnitude plus a unit suffix — whose CSS
//! output must be byte-identical across surfaces. This module owns that
//! spelling so no surface re-derives it, exactly as `crate::color` owns the one
//! CSS colour spelling. Byte-equivalence with the pure-Ipê `Css.lengthToString`
//! (a different language, so it cannot call in here) is held by the
//! `css_length_color_ssot` equivalence guards.

/// A CSS length unit whose spelling is shared across every Ipê surface.
///
/// The set is closed to the genuinely-shared, integer-magnitude units; a
/// surface-specific unit (`Ipe.Ui`'s layout `Fill`/`Content`, `Ipe.Css`'s
/// typographic `Rem`/`Em`/`Ch`/`Fr`) is rendered by its own surface, never
/// here — so this carrier stays the SSOT only for what is actually shared.
