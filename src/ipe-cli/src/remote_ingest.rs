//! The single ingest budget for every byte the CLI takes from a remote party.
//!
//! A package fetch, the index clone `ipe package publish` makes, the installer
//! `ipe upgrade` downloads, and every HTTP response the CLI reads (the GitHub
//! API, the OAuth device flow, the registry read API, the release feed) arrive
//! through this module. Each surface has a declared [`Budget`]: a ceiling on the
//! bytes and entries it may put on disk, the bytes it may buffer in memory, and
//! the wall time it may take. Crossing any of them is an [`IngestRefusal`],
//! surfaced as [`CliError::RemoteIngestExceeded`]; the transfer is stopped, and
//! the caller discards whatever it staged, so nothing partial reaches the lock,
//! the manifest or the package cache.
//!
//! One [`Transfer`] carries one budget and one start instant: every child a
//! transfer runs is held to the same deadline, so a transfer made of several
//! steps shares one wall-time ceiling rather than restarting it per step.
//!
//! Two mechanisms enforce the budgets:
//!
//! - [`read_capped`] reads a stream through `take(cap + 1)`, so an oversized
//!   body is refused without ever being buffered past `cap + 1` bytes.
//! - [`Git`] and [`Curl`] run a child whose output lands on disk. The child is
//!   started in its own process group (on Unix platforms with `waitid`), so a
//!   refusal kills every process it started, not only the direct child; the
//!   interrupt, quit, hangup, stop and continue signals reaching the CLI are
//!   relayed to that group, except a signal the CLI inherited as ignored. The
//!   staged path's size and entry count are sampled at a fixed
//!   interval and the group is killed once either crosses the budget. After the
//!   child exits, its group is killed and one final exact measurement decides
//!   acceptance, so an accepted transfer is always within budget. While it
//!   runs, the disk may briefly hold more than the ceiling, by at most one
//!   [`POLL_INTERVAL`] of transfer throughput.
//!
//! [`Git`] and [`Curl`] are the only constructors of a `git` or `curl` child in
//! the CLI; each fixes the hardened environment and arguments once.
//!
//! LIMIT: a termination request (`SIGTERM`) is not relayed to the groups.
//! `ipe watch` owns the process's `SIGTERM` disposition for its orderly
//! shutdown, and a process holds one disposition per signal, so a relay that
//! ended the CLI on `SIGTERM` would cut that shutdown short. A CLI ended by
//! `SIGTERM` mid-transfer leaves the transfer's group running until it exits on
//! its own; on Linux the direct child receives the parent-death signal, the
//! processes it started do not.
//!
//! LIMIT: git's resident memory is bounded only by the transfer deadline and the
//! group kill. Every fetch step receives the server's ref advertisement, which
//! may differ from the one a pre-checked `ls-remote` saw, and `index-pack`
//! memory scales with the pack. [`Git::isolated`] caps each single allocation
//! at the package per-file ceiling (`GIT_ALLOC_LIMIT`); a cap on the child's
//! address space would need a pre-exec hook, which needs `unsafe`.
