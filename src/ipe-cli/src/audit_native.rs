//! Tier-2 native-code capability enforcement — differential confinement.
//!
//! Tier-1 (`audit.rs`) proves capability honesty over the Ipê-inferable set.
//! Where a package crosses into native `Rust.` code it carries the `native-ffi`
//! axis, and inference is blind past that marker. Tier-2 turns "declared on the
//! author's word" into "observed under confinement and reconciled": it builds
//! and exercises the package's native code inside a jail scoped to *exactly* the
//! declared capability set, then reconciles observed-vs-declared, fail-closed on
//! every mismatch (ADR 0046).
//!
//! ## The observation is by denial, not by tracing
//!
//! No syscall tracer exists. Instead the reconciler reads the *outcome* of a
//! declared-scoped jailed run: a withheld axis the native code demands surfaces
//! as a denial ([`ipe_sandbox::build_jail::JailOutcome::Denied`]) naming the
//! axis (used-but-undeclared); a declared axis the code never needs is found by
//! *tightening* — removing that axis and re-running — cross-checked against the
//! static wrapper scan so the check never pushes an author to under-declare a
//! genuinely-present capability.
//!
//! ## The untrusted build is a CHILD of our probe wrapper
//!
//! The single most security-load-bearing structural rule: the untrusted
//! `cargo build` must never be the top-level payload of the jail, or the package
//! would own its own `exit(0)` and could forge a [`JailOutcome::Clean`]. The
//! probe wrapper we author is always the payload's first element; the untrusted
//! build is passed to it as a subordinate argument. [`ProbePayload`] makes that
//! unrepresentable: it can only be constructed with the wrapper first, so no
//! call site can invert the relationship.
