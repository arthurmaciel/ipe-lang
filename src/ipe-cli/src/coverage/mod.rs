//! The stdlib coverage matrix: one deep enumeration of the exported surface, one
//! `surface × aspect` runner, and the static (registry-only) aspect columns.
//!
//! "No stdlib symbol is forgotten in any aspect" is otherwise a hope split across
//! shallow gates with seams between them. Here the surface is enumerated once
//! ([`surface::StdlibSurface`]), every aspect is a column applied to every symbol
//! ([`matrix::run`]), and a hole is named at its `(symbol, aspect)` coordinate.
//! The [`contract`] types are the seam the dynamic/build columns code to.
