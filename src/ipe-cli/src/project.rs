//! Multi-module project manifest parsing, module discovery, import graph, and
//! topological sort.
//!
//! `package.ipe` is the sole project manifest the toolchain discovers and
//! builds. A legacy `ipe.toml` is not accepted as a project manifest;
//! [`migration_pending`] detects that case so callers can surface
//! [`MIGRATE_CONFIG_HINT`] instead of a silent fallback.
//!
//! # Discovery
//!
//! Given a project directory (containing `package.ipe`), the driver:
//!
//! 1. Reads `package.ipe` to obtain the project name and confirm the source root
//!    exists (`src/` by default).
//! 2. Walks `src/` recursively, collecting every `*.ipe` file.
//! 3. Maps each file path to a module name by:
//!    - Stripping the `src/` prefix and `.ipe` suffix.
//!    - Splitting on the OS path separator to obtain segment strings.
//!    - Rejecting any segment that is not a valid Ipê module segment
//!      (`[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]*`).
//! 4. The entry module is always `Main` (`src/Main.ipe`).
//!
//! # Topological sort
//!
//! A three-colour DFS (White / Gray / Black) produces a stable dep-first
//! ordering of all discovered modules. A Gray → Gray back-edge is an import
//! cycle ([`CycleError`]).
