//! The `ipe` help system — a data-driven renderer for the top-level help
//! screen and every per-command `--help` page.
//!
//! One table ([`COMMANDS`]) binds each command to its handler and its `.md` help
//! page ([`crate::help_page`]): the page holds the synopsis, argument
//! description, and option list; `help/index.md` groups the commands into the
//! overview's sections. Both the overview and the per-command pages render from
//! those pages, so a command or flag is described once, in Markdown.
//!
//! Colour is opt-in per output stream: ANSI escapes are emitted only when the
//! destination is a terminal and `NO_COLOR` is unset. Piped or redirected
//! output — and any run under `NO_COLOR` — is clean, aligned plain text.
//!
//! `--help --json` emits the entire command grammar as a stable JSON object (schema
//! `"ipe.cli.help/1"`), so tooling can discover every command, flag, and section
//! without scraping the human-text screen.
