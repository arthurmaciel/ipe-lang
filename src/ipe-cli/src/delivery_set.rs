//! The delivery set — which deliveries a project's `ipe release` produces, and
//! the release loop that builds every one of them.
//!
//! Three layers, each a parse boundary (parse, don't validate); the next never
//! re-checks what the previous established:
//!
//! * [`ShipEntry`] — one delivery as read from `package.ipe`'s `ships` list,
//!   before the program's shape is known. Produced only by the manifest reader.
//! * [`DeliverySet`] — the non-empty, duplicate-free set resolved against the
//!   pinned shape, every member individually admitted by [`Delivery::resolve`]
//!   (the one validity table). Constructible only through [`DeliverySet::resolve`].
//! * [`ReleaseOutcome`] — the loop's only exit. [`Released`] has a private
//!   constructor, so it exists only as evidence a packager ran to completion;
//!   [`ReleaseOutcome::AllReleased`] is produced only when the loop consumed
//!   every declared delivery, so a partial success has a different type
//!   constructor and no call site can mistake it for success.
//!
//! Because a delivery set is non-empty by parse, duplicate-free by parse, and
//! consumed (`self`) by the loop, a declared-but-unbuilt delivery is
//! unrepresentable: the set cannot be iterated halfway and dropped, and
//! `AllReleased` cannot be built without one `Released` per declared delivery.
