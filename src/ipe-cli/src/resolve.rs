//!
//! The flow for an index dependency ([`resolve_and_add`]): read the index entry,
//! resolve the highest version satisfying the requirement, `git`-fetch that
//! version's source at its pinned revision into the package cache, hash the
//! fetched tree, and **verify the hash equals the one the index pinned before
//! anything is written**. Only then is the resolution recorded — in `ipe.lock`
//! (the exact pins) and in `package.ipe`'s `dependencies` block (the requirement)
//! — and the resolved version and its capability set printed for consent.
//!
//! The `{git=}` / `{path=}` escapes ([`resolve_escape`]) bypass the index by
