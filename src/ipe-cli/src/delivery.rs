//! The delivery grammar — one typed model of `ipe (build|release|watch) [shape]
//! [runtime] [host] [target] [--static]` and the single source of truth for
//! which combinations are valid.
//!
//! Two orthogonal axes place every program (spec § 0):
//!
//! * **shape** — what `view` renders (DOM / cells / lines / http / none). Pinned
//!   by the head of `main`, never redeclared. The optional leading `[shape]`
//!   positional is a *validated cross-check* against `main`, not a second source
//!   of truth.
//! * **runtime × host** — for the `web` shape only, whether the loop is
//!   co-located (`served`, the unnamed default) or sandboxed (`solo`), and which
//!   host carries it.
//!
//! Every invalid combination is a [`DeliveryError`] — a kind-teacher diagnostic
//! that names the problem, explains the two-axis picture in a sentence, and
//! gives the fix. The message set lives here so it is itself a single source of
//! truth (spec § 6).
//!
//! Invalid states are unrepresentable: a resolved [`Delivery`] can only be built
//! by [`Delivery::resolve`], which admits nothing the validity table rejects.
