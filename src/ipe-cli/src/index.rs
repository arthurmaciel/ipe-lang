//! The package index entry schema and reader.
//!
//! The index is a git repository holding one entry file per package at
//! `packages/<name>.toml`. An entry lists every published version, and for each
//! the source repository, its pinned revision, the sha256 of the source tree at
//! that revision, and the capability set the publisher declared. Resolution
//! ([`resolve_version`]) picks the highest published version satisfying a
//! [`semver::VersionReq`].
//!
//! Parse, don't validate: an entry file is read into a typed [`IndexEntry`] whose
//! versions are [`semver::Version`] and whose capabilities are [`Capability`], so
//! a malformed version or an unknown capability name is a hard error at read
//! time, never a resolution-time surprise.
//!
//! [`SourceUrl`] and [`CommitId`] are typed newtypes that gate the two
//! publisher-controlled fields. An unvalidated string can never reach the `git`
//! subprocess — it must first pass through one of these constructors.
