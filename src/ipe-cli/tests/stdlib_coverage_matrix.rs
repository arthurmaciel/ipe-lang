#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! The stdlib coverage-matrix gate: the reconciled surface enumerates every
//! exported symbol, and the static aspect columns judge each on home, resolves,
//! closed-scheme, and layer-agreement.
//!
//! This is the spine that turns "no stdlib symbol is forgotten in any aspect"
//! into a checked property: one enumeration, one `surface × aspect` grid, a hole
//! named at its coordinate. A1 pins the surface's facets on a known symbol; A2
//! runs the four static columns over the WHOLE current surface.

/// did not introduce.

/// Each entry is `(aspect, dotted-symbol, reason)`.
///
/// `Cmd` and `Sub` are the only genuinely home-less kernel qualifiers: they are
/// TEA-loop machinery that is always imported through the shape-scoped
/// `Ipe.Tea.<Shape>.Cmd` / `.Sub` paths rather than a standalone `Ipe.Cmd` /
/// `Ipe.Sub` module. A standalone module is deliberately absent (importing it
/// would create an ambiguous shape association); the qualifiers are internal
/// routing tokens, not importable paths. No `QUALIFIER_MODULE_OVERRIDES` entry
/// is possible without inventing a phantom module.
///
/// The original 14 `Attr`/`EmailAddress`/`Key`/`Mac`/`UiCells` entries were
/// resolved by wiring those qualifiers to their real compiled-source homes in
/// `coverage::surface::QUALIFIER_MODULE_OVERRIDES` (issue #1699).
