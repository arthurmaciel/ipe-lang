//! Soundness regression for the tail-recursive rewrite of `Result.combine` /
//! `Maybe.combine` — collecting a large list runs in CONSTANT native stack, so
//! a well-typed program cannot abort via a Rust stack overflow (guard-page
//! `abort()` → SIGABRT) on a long input.
//!
//! Both combinators walk their input with an accumulator helper and reverse
//! once at the base, a self-tail-recursive shape the backend lowers to a flat
//! `loop { … continue }`. The former recurse-then-cons body ran one frame per
//! element in a non-tail position, so a long input blew the native stack.
//!
//! This golden pins the fix: `Result.combine` and `Maybe.combine` over
//! `500_000` all-success elements each run to a clean exit under a 512 KiB
//! main-thread stack, printing the collected length (`500000`) — proving the
//! collection is value-correct as well as non-crashing. A one-frame-per-element
//! recursion of that depth would SIGABRT (`exit_code == None`) first.
//!
//! Gated on `IPE_E2E=1` (emitted-project cargo build/run), like the other
//! end-to-end goldens. Run: `IPE_E2E=1 cargo test --test g_core_data`.
