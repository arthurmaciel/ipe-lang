//! Recursion-soundness gate: MUTUALLY-recursive ADTs whose size
//! cycle is closed only through enum-payload edges (`Even -> Odd -> Even`).
//! `ipe` must emit `main.rs` byte-identical to the checked-in golden, and
//! (behind `IPE_E2E=1`) the emitted project must build and print `5`.
//!
//! ```text
//! type Even = EZero | ESucc Odd
//! type Odd  = OSucc Even
//! ```
//!
//! Neither enum is *directly* self-recursive — `Even` carries an `Odd` and
//! `Odd` carries an `Even` — so boxing only a direct self-edge would emit two
//! enums that are each infinite-sized in Rust (E0072): `ipe` exits 0 and the
//! emitted crate then fails `cargo build`. So the backend boxes at least one
//! enum-payload edge of every type-size cycle, so each enum
//! stays finite-sized, balanced by `Box::new` at construction and a deref at
//! pattern binding.
//!
//! Behavioural-parity oracle: the Go reference compiler at
//! `/home/arthur/Documentos/comp/ipe/out/ipe` compiles + runs the SAME
//! `Main.ipe` to stdout `5\n`, exit 0 — hand-verified in a temp dir. This is
//! the soundness-floor regression for a value laundered through a boxed
//! mutually-recursive payload, pinning the indirect-cycle gap so it can never
//! regress to the silent exit-0-then-cargo-fail mode.
