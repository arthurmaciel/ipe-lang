//! End-to-end SEAL for `Store.orderByLeft` / `Store.orderByRight`. Two
//! `Codec.auto`-derived stores join on `books.author_id = authors.id`;
//! `orderByRight .name Desc` attaches `ORDER BY a1.name DESC` to the join,
//! which lowers to `Db.findJoinOrdered` (arity 11) — the eleven-arg variant
//! that appends the validated ORDER BY clause. Every identifier (both tables,
//! both aliases, every projected column, the order-by alias and column) is
//! re-validated at the runtime boundary, and the filter value binds as a
//! parameter — never interpolated.
//!
//! THE SEAL: `ipe` accepting the ordered-join program (exit 0) must imply a
//! buildable emitted crate. Under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted crate must
//! `cargo build` (no live database or network is needed — the join is assembled,
//! never executed).
