//! Fail-closed refusals for `Store.select` projections (IPE-L0149).
//!
//! `Store.select` accepts a projection body that is a bare `side.field` column
//! reference, or a flat tuple of such references. Anything else — a computed
//! value, a literal, a nested tuple — must be a fail-closed build error, never a
//! partial statement or a `SELECT *`. Each case here is driven by a real `.ipe`
//! program whose stores and join are well-formed; only the projection body is at
//! fault, so the build must be rejected with exactly IPE-L0149. Asserting only
//! `is_err()` would pass on any unrelated failure and leave the refusal unproven,
//! so each test pins the diagnostic code.

// A failed `panic` in these tests is the failure signal — the test fixture
// does not compile or produce a build artifact for the runtime to execute.
