//! `Ipe.Db.Sql` negative gate: a naive string-concatenated WHERE
//! clause must be REJECTED at `ipe` compile time, never accepted and left to
//! misbehave (or be silently injectable) at runtime. This is the core
//! "parse, don't validate" property the `SqlFragment` newtype exists to
//! establish — `Db.findWhere` / `Db.deleteWhere` take `SqlFragment`, not
//! `String`, so a hand-built WHERE string is a `IPE-T0001` type mismatch, not
//! a representable runtime value.
//!
//! Compile-only: these fixtures never run (there is nothing to execute — the
//! program is ill-typed), so there is no oracle / `IPE_E2E` gate here, unlike
//! `golden_m5b_db.rs`'s runnable goldens.
