//! `Store.upsert`: a conflict target derived from the store's declared key.
//!
//! The `db_store_upsert` golden drives every runtime refusal (no key, several
//! `unique` columns, an illegal key declaration, an unknown or invalid target
//! column, a DB-filled key, a `NULL` key) and every accepted shape (single,
//! composite, `unique`-column and renamed key) against a live
//! `sqlite::memory:` database, one oracle line each. Passing a `Draft` or a
//! `Secured` store never reaches the runtime: each is an ipe-time `IPE-T0001`,
//! so an upsert can bypass neither deny-by-default nor a row policy.
//!
//! ```text
//! # ipe-time refusals only (fast):
//! cargo test -p ipe --test g_db golden_db_store_upsert
//! # full (cargo build + run the golden):
//! IPE_E2E=1 cargo test -p ipe --test g_db golden_db_store_upsert
