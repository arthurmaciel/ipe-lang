//! A `Ipe.Db.Store.Cond` built in a nested (composed) position lowers to its
//! emitted enum instead of reaching the lowerer as an unhomed type constructor.
//!
//! `Store.eq` returns a `Cond row`; its kernel scheme carries the real
//! `Ipe.Db.Store` home so the lowerer's home-keyed variant lookup finds the
//! emitted `Cond` enum. Referenced in a lambda passed to `List.map` — the
//! nested composition shape — the result type annotation `List (Store.Cond User)`
//! lowers to `List Cond`. Before the home was carried, the unqualified `Cond`
//! missed every home-keyed guard and fell through to the empty-home
//! internal-compiler-error arm (IPE-I0001).
