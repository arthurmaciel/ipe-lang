//! End-to-end SEAL for the typed two-store inner join (`Store.join` /
//! `joinFilterRight` / `joinToList`). Two `Codec.auto`-derived stores join on
//! `books.author_id = authors.id`; the join lowers to ONE parameterized
//! statement over a two-table `FROM` (`Db.findJoin`), and each matched pair is
//! decoded through its own store codec. Every identifier (both tables, both
//! aliases, every projected column) is re-validated at the runtime boundary, and
//! the filter value binds as a parameter — never interpolated.
//!
//! THE SEAL: `ipe` accepting the joined program (exit 0) must imply a buildable
//! emitted crate. Under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted crate must `cargo build` (no live
//! database or network is needed — the join is assembled, never executed).
