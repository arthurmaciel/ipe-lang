//! Fail-closed gate: with the same-top-constructor restriction
//! lifted, exhaustiveness over the nested shape is still proven BEFORE emit.
//!
//! A NESTED non-exhaustive `case` (`Som (Som x) -> … ; Non -> …`, missing
//! `Som Non`) must surface IPE-T0010 from the usefulness checker — never reach
//! the backend, so rustc never sees a non-exhaustive `match` (the soundness
//! floor). This locks the property that removing the IPE-L0116 gate did NOT
//! remove the exhaustiveness guarantee: the Maranget check is the gate.
