//! Recursion-soundness gate: a self-edge routed through a TUPLE
//! payload. `ipe` must emit `main.rs` byte-identical to the checked-in golden,
//! and (behind `IPE_E2E=1`) the emitted project must build and print `5`.
//!
//! ```text
//! type Chain = ChainEnd | ChainNode (Chain, Int)
//! ```
//!
//! `ChainNode`'s payload is the tuple `(Chain, Int)`, which reaches `Chain`
//! again — the type-size cycle is closed *through a tuple*, not as a bare
//! self-field. Boxing only a direct self-edge would emit
//! `ChainNode((MainChain, i64))` — an infinite-sized Rust enum (E0072): `ipe`
//! exits 0 and the crate then fails `cargo build`. So the backend boxes the
//! cyclic enum-payload edge (the whole tuple, `ChainNode(Box<(MainChain, i64)>)`),
//! balanced by `Box::new` at construction and a deref at pattern binding.
//!
//! Note: the Go reference parser does NOT accept a tuple type as a constructor
//! payload, so there is no Go oracle for this exact source — `ipec` accepts a
//! superset here. The in-test hand-computed `5` is the oracle, and the gate's
//! load-bearing assertion is that the emitted crate BUILDS (no E0072) and runs,
//! pinning the indirect-cycle soundness floor so it can never regress to the
//! silent exit-0-then-cargo-fail mode.
