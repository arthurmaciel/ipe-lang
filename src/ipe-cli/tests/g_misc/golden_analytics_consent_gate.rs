//! `Ipe.Analytics` consent-gate, `Pii`-redaction gate, and ambient-stringify
//! side-channel closure proof.
//!
//! Proves:
//!
//!   1. `track` with `Granted` consent reaches the sink (no crash, task
//!      succeeds, sentinel line printed to stdout).
//!   2. `track` with `Denied` or `Pending` consent is fail-closed — the event
//!      is dropped silently; the task still succeeds.
//!   3. `Pii` serialises as `"[redacted]"` through the explicit encode path
//!      (`encodePropValue`) — the raw plaintext is never reachable through the
//!      module's public API.
//!   4. `PMoney` serialises losslessly as `{"amount":"…","currency":"…"}`.
//!   5. `Basics.toString (Analytics.pii "…")` does NOT contain the plaintext —
//!      the ambient `toString` / string-interpolation side channel is closed.
//!      `Pii` wraps a `Secret`; the `Secret` field's `IpeStringify` impl always
//!      returns the redacted placeholder, making plaintext leakage structurally
//!      impossible in the emitted Rust.
//!   6. `Basics.toString (PPii (Analytics.pii "…"))` likewise does NOT expose
//!      the plaintext — the `PPii` constructor's `IpeStringify` auto-derive
//!      recurses into the `Secret` field's redacting impl.
//!
//! Invariants (3)–(6) are checked inside `Main.ipe`; `allPure` must be `true`
//! for the task chain to reach the sentinel stdout line. The E2E test is the
//! key evidence that the plaintext no longer appears: any stringification leak
//! causes `allPure = false` → stdout `analytics-FAIL-pure` → assertion fails.
//! Expected stdout: `analytics-consent-gate-ok` (one line).
