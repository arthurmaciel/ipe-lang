//! Machine-checked proof that every golden test that byte-diffs a checked-in
//! golden `main.rs` uses the shared directory-diff harness
//! (`crate::support::assert_emitted_project_matches_golden_dir`) — see design doc §2.4
//! step 5 / Task 9. A POSITIVE check: we assert the shared helper is present on
//! every byte-diffing golden, not merely that some retired hand-roll is absent
//! (a syntactically different but still-stale hand-roll would pass a negative
//! grep while staying unmigrated).
//!
//! # The exemption is STRUCTURAL, not a hand-maintained name list
//!
//! Earlier revisions carried a `NEVER_BYTE_DIFFED` allowlist: every golden that
//! runs / inspects the emitted source (SEAL `emitted.contains(...)`, exit-0,
//! `outcome.stdout`, Pipeline-diagnostic) but never compares it to a checked-in
//! golden `main.rs` had to be named there by hand, and every sweep that added
//! such a golden re-tripped the gate until someone extended the list. That list
//! grew without bound and needed a self-validating second invariant to stop a
//! genuinely-byte-diffing file being parked on it to dodge the first.
//!
//! Both are replaced by ONE structural fact the gate derives per file:
//!
//! > A golden test byte-diffs a checked-in golden `main.rs` **iff** it references
//! > a fixture directory `tests/golden/<name>/` that actually contains a
//! > committed `main.rs`.
//!
//! The shared helper compares `<out>/src/main.rs` against `<golden_dir>/main.rs`
//! (see [`crate::support::assert_emitted_project_matches_golden_dir`]); every golden
//! that byte-diffs does so against a `tests/golden/<name>/main.rs` that must
//! exist on disk. A SEAL / run / exit-0 test references only fixture dirs that
//! carry a `Main.ipe` but NO `main.rs` — there is, by construction, nothing to
//! byte-diff, so the dir-diff helper is inapplicable and the file is
//! AUTO-EXEMPT. A future SEAL golden that ships no golden `main.rs` never
//! re-trips this gate; a future byte-diffing golden that ships a golden
//! `main.rs` but forgets the helper is still caught.
//!
//! # The single invariant (one file walk)
//!
//! Every `golden_*.rs` that references a `tests/golden/<name>/main.rs` present
//! on disk MUST call the shared helper. Nothing else is required to; nothing on
//! any list is trusted — membership in the "must call the helper" set is proven
//! per run from the filesystem, so the gate cannot silently rot as goldens are
//! added.
