//! Every exported `Ipe.Random` member is CALLABLE from user code and completes
//! the SEAL.
//!
//! `Ipe.Random` is a compiled-source Layer-3 module: the entropy-Task tier
//! (`int`/`float`/`range`/`choice`/`shuffle`/`weighted`) resolves through
//! `Ffi.kernel "Random_*"` aliases to the registered `Random*` kernels, and the
//! seeded tier (`seed`/`seededInt`/`seededFloat`/`seededChoice` over the opaque
//! `Seed`) is pure Ipê over the seeded raw kernels
//! (`tests/golden/random_members/Main.ipe`). This pins ipe-0 ∧ cargo-0 ∧ run-0
//! (THE SEAL: ipe exit 0 ⇒ emitted Rust builds and runs): the entropy tier is
//! drawn through `Cmd.perform` and the seeded tier is asserted reproducible
//! (two draws from one `Seed` agree), so the rendered line is stable.
//!
//! Gated on `IPE_E2E=1`. Run:
//! `IPE_E2E=1 cargo test -p ipe --test g_issues golden_i672`.
