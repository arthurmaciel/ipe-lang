//! Regression: a let-bound record literal with a bare function field and no
//! type annotation must be rejected with IPE-L0107, not reach struct synthesis
//! and ICE with IPE-I0001.
//!
//! The shape — `let rec = { shouldRetry = \n -> n + 1 }` inside `main` with no
//! type annotation on `rec` — has its solved record type only in the solver's
//! region map, never in any top-level binding's inferred type (`SolvedTypes::env`).
//! The backend's signature scan therefore registers no struct for the shape; the
//! lowerer's `collect_records_in_ty` G-b gate skips it; and `record_struct_by_key`
//! raises a `CompilerBug` ICE (IPE-I0001) when the backend tries to emit the
//! record literal.
//!
//! Fix: the `reject_function_valued_field` gate in the `Expr_::Record` lowering
//! arm detects that the region type has a bare `Ty::Fun` field whose field-name
//! set does not appear in any env type, and emits IPE-L0107 before struct
//! synthesis is reached.
//!
//! Boundary: a record with a function field whose type IS declared in a top-level
//! binding annotation (e.g. `guard : Guard` with `type alias Guard = { shouldRetry
//! : Int -> Int }`) still compiles — the backend registers its struct from the
//! function signature.
