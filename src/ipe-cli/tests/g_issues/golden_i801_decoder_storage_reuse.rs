//! Seal — a GENERIC combinator that stores a BARE runtime `Decoder a` in its
//! representation, reads it back out, and forwards it into `Decode.list` was
//! `ipe`-accepted (exit 0) but the emitted crate failed `cargo build`: the stored
//! decoder read (`r.dec`) emits a `.clone()` (value semantics — a field read is a
//! copy), and the runtime `Decoder<E, T>` was a non-`Clone`, non-`Copy`
//! `Box<dyn Fn>`, so the clone (and the old reuse-factory closure that moved it)
//! could not compile. This is the decode-side mirror of the encode-side seal:
//! a stored function value rides a clonable `Arc` carrier, and now so does a
//! stored decoder.
//!
//! The fix flips the runtime `Decoder`'s carrier from `Box<dyn Fn + Send>` to
//! `Arc<dyn Fn + Send + Sync>`, making a `Decoder` `Clone` (a refcount bump) while
//! keeping it `Send` for the DB / Config async paths, and takes the list / dict
//! element decoder by value (borrowed across every element and document) instead
//! of through a reuse-factory closure that would have to move a non-`Copy`
//! decoder out of an `Fn`.
//!
//! The fixture stores a bare `Decoder a` at TWO element instantiations (`Int` and
//! `String`) and decodes each box TWICE — proving the stored decoder is reusable
//! across monomorphisations AND across repeated use:
//! `ints=3 ints=2 strs=3 strs=1`.
//!
//! The load-bearing proof is the SEAL: under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted crate must
//! `cargo build`, run, and exit 0.
