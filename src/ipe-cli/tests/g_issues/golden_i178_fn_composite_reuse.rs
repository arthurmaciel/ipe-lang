//! Function values in record fields — the `SharedFun` carrier under carrier
//! normalization (Phase 1).
//!
//! A record whose fields include function values carries those slots on the
//! `Clone` `Arc<dyn Fn>` carrier ([`ipe_ir::IrType::SharedFun`]) — always, as a
//! total function of the record's shape. The whole struct then gets a
//! hand-written `Clone`, so the N-1 last-use clone rewrite makes it move-safe.
//! The record is storable regardless of whether it escapes; a record that also
//! carries a non-`Clone` field (`Task`) still fails closed on reuse.
//!
//! | Fixture | Shape | Outcome |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `fn_record_reuse_promoted` | record of two functions + data, reused | stored; builds + prints `len: 8` |
//! | `fn_record_reuse_escapes` | that record RETURNED from a function | stored; builds + prints `12` |
//! | `fn_record_reuse_mixed` | fn field + `Task` field, reused | fail-closed IPE-L0127 (not whole-clonable) |
//!
//! Carrier normalization (Phase 1) makes a function in a record field always the
//! `Arc<dyn Fn>` carrier — a total function of the record's shape, not a
//! containment-gated promotion. So the escaping record (returned from `mk`) now
//! stores and reuses soundly: every occurrence of its shape agrees on `Arc` by
//! construction, with no frontier a `Box`-carried sibling could reach. The mixed
//! record still fails closed — its `Task` field is not `Clone`, so the whole
//! record cannot be, independent of the fn-slot carrier.
//!
//! A `Send`-not-`Sync` capture control is covered by the carrier-transparency
//! argument, not a distinct fixture: the emitted `Box`/`Arc` carrier already
//! bounds every captured free variable `Send + Sync + 'static`, so a
//! `Send`-not-`Sync` capture is rejected by rustc on the closure upstream of the
//! carrier choice, identically before and after the `Box`->`Arc` swap.
