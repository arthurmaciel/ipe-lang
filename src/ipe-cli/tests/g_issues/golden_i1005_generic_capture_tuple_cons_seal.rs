//! SEAL: a generic recursive helper whose continuation lambda cons-prepends a
//! TUPLE head `(value, 0)` — built from a captured match-arm local `value : a`
//! — onto its `List (a, Int)` result.  The emitter writes a
//! `Box<dyn Fn(Vec<(T1, i64)>) -> Vec<(T1, i64)> + Send + Sync + 'static>`
//! closure that move-captures `value`, so the enclosing generic must carry
//! `where T1: Send + Sync`.  Without the propagated bound the emitted crate is
//! accepted by ipe (exit 0) but fails `cargo build` with E0277.
//!
//! This is the tuple-cons-head shape: the closure body's `Cons` head is a
//! `Tuple`, not a bare `Var`.  The `Sync` obligation is keyed on the CLOSURE's
//! own signature (`Vec<(T1, i64)>` reaches bare `T1`) plus a bare-capture walk,
//! so it fires regardless of how the result is built.
//!
//! The load-bearing proof is the SEAL check: under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted
//! crate must `cargo build`.
