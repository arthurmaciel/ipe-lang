//! SEAL: `Ipe.Db.Store` list-returning queries emit `decodeRows`, a generic
//! helper over the row type `a`.  The helper builds a
//! `Box<dyn Fn(Vec<T1>) -> Vec<T1> + Send + Sync + 'static>` closure that
//! captures a `T1` value, so the enclosing function must carry
//! `where T1: Send + Sync`.  Without the propagated bound the emitted crate
//! is accepted by ipe (exit 0) but fails `cargo build` with E0277 — a SEAL
//! violation affecting every `Store.all` / `Store.findWhere` call site.
//!
//! Root cause: the bound-propagation pass in the lowerer walked only
//! function-level *params* for the capture-of-generic-by-closure check; it
//! did not see the `Ok value ->` match-arm local whose type is `Generic(a)`
//! — that local is captured by the `\more -> value :: more` lambda passed to
//! `Task.map`.  The fix keys the `Sync` obligation on the CLOSURE's own
//! signature: `body_move_closure_captures_generic` fires on any
//! `Lambda`/`SharedLambda` whose param/return type `reaches_bare` the tvar AND
//! that move-captures a free value carrying the tvar bare (a bare-value
//! capture, or a read of a transparent field whose type reaches the tvar).
//!
//! The load-bearing proof is the SEAL check: under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted
//! crate must `cargo build` (no database connection required — the fixture
//! never executes a query at runtime).
