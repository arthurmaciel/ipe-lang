//! Seal — a GENERIC stdlib-style codec combinator that stores a function in its
//! representation and forwards it into a JSON kernel was `ipe`-accepted (exit 0)
//! but the emitted crate failed `cargo build` with two `E0277`s:
//!
//! 1. **Missing `Send` bound.** `decodeList : Codec a -> String -> Result Error
//!    (List a)` emits `fn <T1: Clone>` but its body builds a `Decoder (List a)`
//!    through `decode_list`, whose runtime element bound is `T: 'static + Send`.
//!    The `Decoder a` is hidden inside the `Codec a` ADT field, invisible to the
//!    signature-level obligation walk, so the `Send` bound was dropped.
//! 2. **No `SharedFun` → kernel-arg `Fn` coercion.** `encodeList` reads the codec's
//!    stored encoder (a `SharedFun` / `Arc<dyn Fn>`) and passes it into
//!    `json_enc_list`, whose element-encoder parameter is a bare `impl Fn` —
//!    `Arc<dyn Fn>` does not `impl Fn`.
//!
//! The fix propagates the runtime-required `Send + 'static` onto the generic and
//! eta-demotes the shared read onto the `Box<dyn Fn>` carrier the `impl Fn` slot
//! accepts (`move |eta_0| (read)(eta_0)`), the kernel-arg sibling of the
//! record-field read demotion.
//!
//! The fixture exercises the combinator at TWO element instantiations (`List Int`
//! and `List String`) to prove the propagated bound and the coercion hold across
//! monomorphisations, then round-trips both:
//! `[1,2,3] ints=3 ["a","b"] strs=3`.
//!
//! The load-bearing proof is the SEAL: under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted crate must
//! `cargo build`, run, and exit 0.
