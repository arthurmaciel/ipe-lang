//! A wildcard `any` in PARAMETER position that the body THREADS into an `any`
//! return (`thread : any -> any; thread x = x`) must not emit a generic
//! parameter beside a concrete return. The checker unifies the two independent
//! `any` occurrences through the body, so the parameter's solved type is the
//! single call-site-pinned concrete type; emitting the parameter as a generic
//! `T{n}` while the return is that concrete type makes the body return the
//! generic where the concrete is expected (E0308) — an accept-then-`cargo`-fail
//! (THE SEAL). A wildcard `any` has ONE concrete lowering per position: the
//! threaded parameter concretizes to the same type as the return.
//!
//! The positive cases route through [`support::assert_seal_builds`] so the SEAL
//! claim is backed by an actual `cargo build` under `IPE_E2E=1`.
