//! Recursion-soundness gate: a self-edge routed through a RECORD
//! payload. `ipe` must emit `main.rs` byte-identical to the checked-in golden,
//! and (behind `IPE_E2E=1`) the emitted project must build and print `5`.
//!
//! ```text
//! type RChain = REnd | RNode { rest : RChain, val : Int }
//! ```
//!
//! `RNode`'s payload is the record `{ rest : RChain, val : Int }`, whose `rest`
//! field reaches `RChain` again — the type-size cycle `RChain -> RecRestVal ->
//! RChain` is closed *through a record*. Boxing only a direct self-edge would
//! emit `RNode(RecRestVal)` with `RecRestVal { rest: MainRChain, .. }` —
//! mutually infinite-sized Rust types (E0072): `ipe` exits 0 and the crate then
//! fails `cargo build`. So the backend boxes the cyclic enum-payload edge
//! (`RNode(Box<RecRestVal>)`), which breaks the cycle without
//! touching the record struct, balanced by `Box::new` at construction and a
//! deref at pattern binding (`let rec = *rec;`).
//!
//! Note: the reference parser does NOT accept a record type as a constructor
//! payload, so there is no golden oracle for this exact source — `ipec` accepts a
//! superset here. The in-test hand-computed `5` (`3 + 2`) is the oracle, and the
//! gate's load-bearing assertion is that the emitted crate BUILDS (no E0072) and
//! runs, pinning the indirect-cycle soundness floor so it can never regress to
//! the silent exit-0-then-cargo-fail mode.
