//! The stringly row-read surface is `Ipe.Db.Unsafe.unsafeQuery` /
//! `unsafeGetField` / `unsafeGetString` / `unsafeGetInt` / `unsafeGetBool`, and
//! neither the old unmarked names nor the relocated `Db.unsafe*` off a plain
//! `import Ipe.Db` exist. This pins the schema-drift property that the
//! silently-coercing row readers are only reachable through the lexically-marked
//! `unsafe` names in the disclosed `Ipe.Db.Unsafe` submodule — a caller cannot
//! fall into a `"" `/`0`-on-drift read by using an unmarked default, nor without
//! disclosing the `unsafe` capability. The typed `Db.queryDecode` +
//! `Db.Decode.*` path (which a missing/renamed column fails closed on) is the
//! unmarked row-read default and stays in `Ipe.Db`.
//!
//! The guarantee is checked on BOTH resolution routes:
//!
//! * the surface qualifier (`Unsafe.unsafeGetField` off `import Ipe.Db.Unsafe`,
//!   and — for the relocation — `Db.unsafeGetField` off plain `Ipe.Db` failing),
//!   and
//! * the `Ffi.kernel "Db_unsafeGetField"` string-alias route. Minting a kernel
//!   alias is the exclusive privilege of the driver-vouched standard library /
//!   FFI interface: a `Ffi.kernel "…"` binding in USER source is rejected by the
//!   origin gate (IPE-N0042) before the registry is even consulted. So the
//!   string-alias route cannot smuggle a user program to the marked kernel at
//!   all — the only path to the unsafe row read stays the disclosed
//!   `Ipe.Db.Unsafe` surface. This closes the capability-model bypass whereby a
//!   user `Ffi.kernel` alias reached an unsafe kernel with no `unsafe`
//!   disclosure.
