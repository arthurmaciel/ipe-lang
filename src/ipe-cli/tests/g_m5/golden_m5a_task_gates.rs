//! Task type-annotation gate: the error channel of `Task E a` must always be
//! `Error`.  Any annotation `Task <X> a` where `X` is not `Error` (e.g. `Task String
//! Int`, `Task Int a`) is a hard type-error, surfacing IPE-T0001 from
//! `normalize_annotation_ty` with message "expected Error, found X".
//!
//! This file tests the REJECT side of the reconciliation fix.  The ACCEPT side
//! (annotations `Task Error a` that now unify with the kernel's unary `Task a`)
//! is exercised by `golden_m5a_task::task_signed_helper`.
