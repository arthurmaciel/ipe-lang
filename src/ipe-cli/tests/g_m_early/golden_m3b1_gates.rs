//! Tuple-pattern shapes. Both shapes are MODELLED end-to-end by the
//! tuple-pattern lowering plus the `ipe_types::exhaust` exhaustiveness/redundancy
//! engine (a shape the lowerer cannot model surfaces a clean, span-carrying
//! IPE-L0115 — never a panic, an internal compiler bug, or silent refutable
//! cargo-failing Rust). These tests pin the verified-correct behaviour:
//!
//! * a `case` on a tuple with MORE THAN ONE arm whose first arm is irrefutable
//!   (`(a, b) -> …` then `(c, d) -> …`): the redundancy checker recognises the
//!   trailing arm is unreachable and the lowerer emits the single useful arm —
//!   `match pair { (a, b) => (a + b) }` — building + running to the right value.
//! * a single-cover tuple `case` with a REFUTABLE element (`(Som x, b)` /
//!   `(Non, b)`): lowered to a real exhaustive Rust match over the constructor —
//!   `match pair { (MainOpt::Som(x), b) => …, (MainOpt::Non, b) => … }`.
//!
//! Each is driven through the full `ipe` pipeline; the build MUST SUCCEED (no
//! IPE-L0115, no other diagnostic) and — behind `IPE_E2E=1` — the emitted crate
//! MUST build with cargo and print the reference value `3`. The anti-goal the
//! original gate guarded against (silent, cargo-FAILING refutable Rust) is
//! covered by the E2E build+run: were an arm dropped unsoundly or a refutable
//! match left non-exhaustive, cargo would reject it.
