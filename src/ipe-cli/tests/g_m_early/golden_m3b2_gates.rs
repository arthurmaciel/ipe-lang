//! Fail-closed gates — each unsupported shape must surface a
//! clean, span-carrying diagnostic, never a panic / internal compiler bug /
//! cargo-failing Rust:
//!
//! * a non-exhaustive NESTED `case` (`Just (Just a) -> … ; Nothing -> …`,
//!   missing `Just Nothing`) → IPE-T0010, caught BEFORE emit so rustc never
//!   sees a non-exhaustive `match` (the soundness floor),
//! * a NESTED redundant arm (`Som x` then the subsumed `Som (Som y)`) →
//!   IPE-T0011, computed over the same nested matrix as exhaustiveness,
//! * a SINGLE-arm tuple `case` with a refutable constructor element over a
//!   one-constructor carrier (type-level exhaustive, so it clears IPE-T0010 but
//!   the lowerer still can't destructure it) → IPE-L0115, and
//! * a REFUTABLE `let` destructure (`let (Wrap x) = …`) → IPE-T0015, caught at
//!   the exhaustiveness/irrefutability gate (a `let` binder is a binding
//!   position: it must be irrefutable), so the backend never emits a refutable
//!   Rust `let` that rustc would reject.
//!
//! (Two arms for the same constructor — once gated as IPE-L0116 — are now
//! supported: each lowers to its own Rust `match` arm in source order. The
//! positive regression lives in `golden_m3b4_nested` / `golden_m3b4_two_same_ctor`,
//! and `golden_m3b4_gates` locks that a non-exhaustive nested same-ctor `case`
//! is still IPE-T0010.)
