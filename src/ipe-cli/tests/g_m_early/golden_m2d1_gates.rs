//! Super-type soundness gate.
//!
//! A generic function whose body constrains a type variable to a Ipê super-type
//! (`Number` via `+ - *`, `Comparable` via `< > <= >=`) generalises to a Rust
//! generic carrying the matching trait bound. Using such a function at a type
//! that does not satisfy the bound — here `double` (which needs `Number`)
//! instantiated at `Bool` — must be rejected at type-checking time (IPE-T0014),
//! never left to fail when `cargo` compiles the emitted Rust. This is the
//! soundness floor for bounded generics: ipe accepting a program it cannot
//! lower to compiling Rust is forbidden.
//!
//! For the `Number` case the golden reference rejects the same program too (its
//! `Number` constraint is not satisfied by `Bool`); the codes differ but both
//! fail closed.
//!
//! The `Equatable`-at-a-function case is a *sanctioned divergence*: a prior
//! backend lowered generic equality to a reflect-based path that quietly accepts a
//! function argument (returning `false`). The Rust backend
//! instead lowers `==` to the static `PartialEq` operator, which Rust never
//! derives for a function — so emitting it would fail `cargo`. ipe therefore
//! rejects equality instantiated at a function type here (IPE-T0014) rather than
//! reproduce a comparison that has no sound Rust meaning.
