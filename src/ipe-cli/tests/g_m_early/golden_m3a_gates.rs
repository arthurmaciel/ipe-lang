//! Fail-closed gates: each unmodelled ADT shape must surface a
//! clean, span-carrying diagnostic — never a panic, an internal compiler bug, or
//! silent cargo-failing Rust.
//!
//! * a constructor pattern binding the wrong number of payload fields →
//!   IPE-T0013 (a type error).
//!
//! (Two `case` arms head-matching the same constructor with a refutable nested
//! payload — `Som (Som x)` then `Som Non` — is now SUPPORTED: each arm lowers to
//! its own Rust `match` arm in source order. Its positive regression lives in
//! `golden_m3b4_nested` / `golden_m3b4_two_same_ctor`.)
//!
//! Note: the partial-ctor-application gap (formerly IPE-L0113) is closed.
//! Positive regressions live in `golden_i147_ctor_as_fn_seal`.
//!
//! Each is driven through the full `ipe` pipeline and asserted to produce its
//! exact code, locking the gap so it can never regress into a worse failure mode.
